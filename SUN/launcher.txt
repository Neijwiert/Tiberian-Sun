   list.

   Westwood Online ladder screen.

   screen.   

Changes in V. 1.17a

   locations.

Changes in V. 1.17

   condition at the end of a multiplayer game.

   errors during multiplayer games.

-  Railgun force fire no longer damages buildings multiple 
   times.

-  Server list no longer displays duplicate servers.

Changes in V. 1.16a.1
---------------------

- Fixed bug where harvester truce could be on in a skirmish game.

- Tweak to improve unit response time at the start of the game.

- If the host of an internet game is using a modified or user 
  created map, the guests will now get a warning message instead 
  of just a blank preview.

- Fix for occasional 'Packet received too late' or 'Reconnection 
  error' at the end of an internet game.

- Fix for possible 'Packet received too late' or 'Reconnection 
  error' when playing a LAN game right after playing an internet game.

- Fix for bug which would allow mixed game versions to start a 
  LAN game with subsequent bad behavior.

- Fix for a bug where the player could get stuck in building 
  placement mode if they lost their last construction yard.

- A new "game speed" slider on Internet Game setup screen. This 
  allows players to set the initial game speed. A game speed 
  slider has also been added to the in-game options top level so 
  that it is easier to access. 

- An improved game setup screen layout (Random map is now a 
  button under multiplay map).
 
- The map select screen now includes a new map preview.

- A new game-latency tolerance setting in the game options screen 
  allows players to increase the tolerance of network latency on 
  laggy connections. 

- New granularity of game speed slider (now has a 45 fps setting). 
  The slider now has the following settings in Internet multiplay. 
  15 fps (middle) 20 fps (default) 30 fps 45 fps (new) 60 fps (max). 

- Advanced code to evaluate and manipulate slow or high latency
  connections. The game now uses the ping times from the lobby/game 
  options screen to set up multiplayer timing values for the game. You 
  should notice that the game runs faster at the start of the game (if 
  you have a good connection) than it used to. 

- New code to reduce bandwidth used when game speed is set to 30
  fps (one notch above the default) or above. 

- Generally reduced bandwidth in multiplayer game. Combined with the 
  above feature, the game now consumes significantly less network 
  bandwidth compared to earlier versions.

- Out of sync due to certain turrets is fixed.

- Fixed a crash in modem disconnect code after playing a game.

- New "locale" setting on login dialog so that you can set your 
  geographic location. This will eventually be used in a future new 
  feature on our web site and in the tournament ladders. 

- New server select dialog. Many players were not aware that they 
  could change the Westwood Online server to which they were initially 
  connected. To address this, we have inserted a "select server" dialog 
  immediately after the login dialog. The game remembers if you change 
  the default and will select that server as default for subsequent logins. 

- New "short game" option added. This mode results in a loss when all
  buildings are lost and leads to a more decisive result when a shorter 
  game is desired. The MCV counts as a building for game over purposes. 

- Up to 32 nicknames can be now stored on the login dialog box. 

- Immediate feedback when giving a move order in multiplayer. 

- Added harvester logic to allow redirection to an alternative refinery. 

- Added notification to other players when game speed or latency settings
  are changed. 

- Added packet CRC check in Internet and network games to address
  problems some users were experiencing with packet corruption with some
  types of network card. (We have not been able to repeat this internally, 
  but RealTek cards seem to be common culprits.) 

Changes in V. 1.13
------------------

- Nod Artillery:Rate of fire decreased
		Damage decreased, approximately 20%
		Less effective against infantry

- Nod SAM site:	Power requirements are now double.

- GDI Disc throwers: Disc throwers now explode when killed 
  and damage any nearby units.

- Concrete and Firestorm walls:  These walls now build like
  laser fences.  If you place one wall section and then 
  place a second, a line is drawn indicating that a wall 
  segment will be built between the two sections.  You are 
  only charged for the cost of the end pieces of the wall, 
  not the connecting pieces.  Also, walls can be sold but 
  you will not receive money for sold sections.   
  Note: If there is an obstacle such as a unit or structure 
  that appears between the sections during placement, the 
  two sections will not connect.

- Structures cannot be built off of laser fence posts.

- If you wall your MCV in and undeploy it, it no longer 
  disappears.

- Holding down 'X' (scatter) key or any other keyboard 
  'event' generating command causes disconnect in modem or 
  dialup internet game. 

- Hunter Seeker code prioritizes targets that could affect 
  end-game situations in multiplayer.

- When harvester truce is enabled, hunter-seekers will no 
  longer destroy harvesters.

- Trainer programs can no longer cheat to unshroud the map.

- Trainer programs cannot be used to disable Fog of War 
  during a game where Fog of War has been enabled.

- When the message 'Computer has been defeated' is printed 
  when an AI loses, the message is printed in the color that 
  matches the AI's units.

- The crash caused when an engineer captures a construction 
  yard while the building placement cursor is active is fixed.

- Banshees can now fire on enemy units or force-fire on the 
  ground within the area of effect of a stealth generator.

- When ordering air units to travel to the top few spaces of 
  a map where there is a lot of water, aircraft now land on 
  the nearest spot of dry land rather than directly on the water.

- The Firestorm defense no longer stays up indefinitely when 
  power goes low.

- The crash when destroying a vein hole monster has been fixed.  
  This crash usually only happened after an extended period of 
  gameplay once the vein hole monster has been killed.

- The game can now run from any valid CD drive, not just the one 
  with the first drive letter.

- French and German sidebar text no longer overflows onto 
  sidebar icons.

- Ping meters are no longer partially covered by the scrollbars 
  in the WOL lobby.

- Find game dialog has been sped up.

  error message was displayed in your message window.  This 
  no longer happens.
